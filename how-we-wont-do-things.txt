1. Allow dual config of yaml & json.
This is because some developers hate yml and prefer json. 
It's relatively cheap to convert a yaml config to boost.json internally and it'll be a good example for boost.json. 
Conversions boost.json -> C++ will also allow us to use describe.

2. use sql to dump extracted data.
The data exctraced by clang should be dumped into an sql database, to be queried later.
This way we can write a asciidoc plugin in ruby, that just queries the DB, e.g.

mr-dox-reference::../boost_json.sqlite
